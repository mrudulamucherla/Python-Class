'''  Write a program that computes the net amount 
of a bank account based a transaction log from console
 input. The transaction log format is shown as
 following: D 100 W 200 D means deposit while W means
 withdrawal. Suppose the following input is supplied
 to the program: D 300 D 300 W 200 D 100 Then, the
 output should be: 500  '''
